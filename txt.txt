THE CONCEPT OF TAX EQUITY AND TAX NEUTRALITY
The principles of tax equity and tax neutrality play crucialroles in shaping international taxation policies, especially within theframework of national economic sovereignty. Here's an explanation of theseconcepts and their significance:

Tax Equity:
Tax equity emphasizes the fair distribution of tax revenuesgenerated from international economic activities among nations. It also advocatesfor equal treatment of taxpayers engaged in cross-border transactions, ensuringthey are neither unfairly favored nor discriminated against in terms of theirtax obligations.

Tax Neutrality:
Tax neutrality refers to the characteristic of tax systemsthat do not influence the economic decisions made by taxpayers. Tax systems canachieve neutrality either through capital export neutrality or capital importneutrality.

Capital Export Neutrality(Domestic Neutrality):
Developed countries often favor capital export neutrality,wherein taxpayers can make investment choices without being swayed by taxconsiderations, whether they invest domestically or abroad. This approach aimsfor global efficiency, allowing investments to flow to where they are most productive.

Capital Import Neutrality(Competitive Neutrality):
Developing countries typically prefer capital importneutrality, which ensures that both domestic and foreign investors face similartax burdens within the country. This approach promotes national efficiency bycreating a level playing field for all investors, regardless of their origin.

The fairness and effectiveness of tax systems depend notonly on individual countries' tax laws but also on the collective impact of taxregulations worldwide. However, due to the lack of global tax harmonization,conflicts arise between domestic tax systems and cross-border transactions,leading to instances of over-taxation and economic distortions.

To address these challenges, international taxation relies onthe principles of enforceability and reciprocity. While countries have theauthority to tax entities and transactions within their jurisdictions, theyface limitations in enforcing tax obligations beyond their borders. Therefore,they must recognize and respect the taxing rights of other countries andcollaborate to develop mutually beneficial tax rules that align with theirfiscal objectives.

In essence, international taxation seeks to strike a balancebetween national sovereignty and global cooperation, aiming to minimizeconflicts, promote fairness, and enhance the efficiency of cross-border taxsystems through shared principles and collaborative efforts among nations.
